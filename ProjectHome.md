**Description**

_The objective of our project is to build up and maintain a system for UST students to order foods from UST canteens through an android app. The biggest feature of our app is Food Recommendation. Once users activate this function, the system automatically gives out the best choice according to food ranking, past ordering or nutrition value. With this app, they do not need to think about what to eat and line up in front of cashiers. This app not only saves their time, but also provides a more enjoyable lunchtime for them._

**Features**

1. Food Recommendation System

2. List ten foods that are most frequently ordered and highest rated in last month or week.

3. View the orders made in last week.

4. Save different diets according to users' preference.

5. Provide nutrition information for different kinds of food.
