=Introduction and Problem Statement=

USTRice is officially start in February 2014 and aims to solve two big problems for UST students and staffs, which are long waiting time when ordering food and difficulties in deciding what to eat in lunch. The waiting time for ordering is divided into three parts, thinking time, queuing time and cooking time. Since we cannot change the cooking time in canteen, we put our effort on thinking time and queuing time. USTRice is an android app with food recommendation and ordering system in it. It is designed to dramatically reduce thinking time and queuing time or even eliminate these two problems from users' mind. The food recommendation system will give the best choice to users according to ranking, past ordering and nutrition value. The food ordering system will save the time for queuing up in front of cashier. We hope that this app can give a more enjoyable lunchtime to all users in UST.
